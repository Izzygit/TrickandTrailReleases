# Trick and Trail VESC Package
by Mike Silberstein (send questions, comments, requests to izzyvesc@gmail.com)

Trick and Trail Package was developed based on Float Package 1.2 by Surfdado and Niko for self-balanced boards. It departs from the traditional PID control scheme that is rooted in the balance robot design. This is replaced with a user defined, current output curve that is based on board pitch. This allows for an infinite number of throttle/braking curves that gives the user the ability to truly tune the board how they want.

This package has been improved thanks to the contributions of Lukas Hrazky with Refloat.

### Features
* Pitch Tune - Current output defined by a series of points, input by the user.
* Roll Tune - for acceleration and braking, to improve board response.
* Yaw Tune - for acceleration and braking, to improve board response.
* Surge - high current response to help prevent nosedives.
* Traction Control - reduce free spin in the air. 
* Sticky Tilt - accurate, manual board level control with a remote.
* Dynamic Stability - faster board response at higher speeds or with a remote.
* Alternative proportional gain user inputs for pitch.
* Optional independent brake curve for pitch.
* High Duty Haptic Buzz - high speed warning.
* High Current Haptic Buzz - instant, high torque warning.

### Default Settings
Default settings are based on 20s battery, Hypercore (Future Motion motor), and Little Focer v3.1 set up. These are the setting I ride for trails. The one exception is surge which is disabled. Here are more details on the default settings:
* Pitch Tune - Loose close to the setpoint but tightens quickly at higher pitch angles.
  * For a street tune you may want the tune to be tighter close to the setpoint. Increase Kp0, Pitch 1 Current, and Pitch 2 Current. You could also decrease Pitch 1 and Pitch 2 angles.
  * For a trick tune you may want it to be looser at higher pitch angles. Increase Pitch 3 angle or decrease Pitch 3 Current.
* Roll Tune - The current roll tune is loose and moderate for easy, deep carving.
  * To make the roll tighter and more race-like, decrease Level 2 Roll Angle.
  * To make the tune less aggressive decrease Roll Kp.
  * To make the tune less agile at low speed reduce the low speed maximum scaler.
  * To adjust the agility at high speed change the high speed maximum scaler.
* Yaw Tune - The current yaw tune is loose and moderately aggressive
  * To make the yaw tighter and more race-like, decrease Level 1 and Level 2 Yaw Angles.
  * To make the tune less aggressive decrease Yaw Kp.
* High Current
  * High current conditions are based on 150 peak amps, 30 battery amps, and hypercore motor.
  * Changes must be made for higher current motors like the cannoncore and superflux.
* Surge 
  * Disabled by default for safety.
  * Set your high current section first.
* Traction Control
  * Should work well for most boards. Light riders on powerful boards may need to increase Start Condition to prevent nuisance trips.
  * Decrease End Condition for smoother landings but beware going too low.
* Haptic Buzz
  * Activated for high duty and high current
  * Riders with cannoncore or superflux motors should disable high current haptic buzz until you correct the high current conditions.

## Change Log
### 1.3
* **Version 1.3 parameters are not compatible with v1.2 and will be set to default. Screenshot your tunes to save.**
* Code refactored thanks to contributions from Lukas Hrazky, author of Refloat.
* _Features_
  * Yaw
    * Yaw kp curves, similar to the roll kp curves, modify the current output based on yaw input.
    * Instead of using angle, like pitch and roll, yaw is measured in angle change per second (how quickly you rotate the board).
    * Minimum ERPM limits yaw response at low speeds.
    * New Yaw menu next to Roll
    * New debug section in AppUI is toggled in Specs tab, allows for accurate yaw tuning.
  * Traction control overhaul
    * Changed traction control inputs/outputs for motor acceleration to ERPM/ms from ERPM/cycle.
    * Changed the minimum delay between traction control activations from 200ms to 20ms
    * Added a new end condition to handle an edge case that would not exit traction control correctly.
    * Remove drop condition from traction control deactivation conditions.
    * Changed the names of parameters to Start Condition and End Condition. Previously, Wheelslip Acceleration Trigger and Wheelslip Margin.
    * End condition can now be negative.
    * Removed parameter Wheelslip Acceleration End.
    * New debug output in AppUI counts how many traction control activations in the last 5 seconds.
    * Changed timeouts from 500ms for traction control, 180ms for transition condition 1, and 200ms for transition condition 2 to 300ms, 210ms, and 220ms respectively.
  * Dynamic Stability
    * Added new parameter Ramp Rate Down. Default 5.0 %/s. Prevents nose dip feeling when reducing speed.
* _Fixes/Improvements_
  * Some parameters changed to integers to reduce packet size.
  * Some features and parameters were removed to make room for new features.
    * Haptic buzz for temperature and voltage
    * Haptic buzz for duty and current is now on/off. Audible2 is the haptic type.
    * Startup roll angle hard coded to 45 degrees.
    * Fault delay roll is now the same as fault delay pitch, called fault delay angle.
    * Feature start up clicks is no longer available.
  * Fixed a bug that would prevent high current haptic buzz if surge was engaged.
  * AppUI now displays the following for state:
    * when idle... "READY-" and last stop/fault reason
    * when running... "RUNNING-" and tiltback reason
    * in traction control/wheelslip... "WHEELSLIP"
  * Readme format updated for 6.05
  * Sticky tilt no longer "remembers" tilt angle after dismount. Resets setpoint to zero every time.

### 1.2
* **Version 1.2 parameters are not compatible with v1.1 and will be set to default. Screenshot your tunes to save.**
* _Features_
  * Haptic Buzz
    * Adopted haptic buzz implementation from Float Package 2.0
    * Overcurrent haptic buzz modified to be instantaneous instead of continuous. Now called High Current.
    * High Current haptic buzz now has a user input duration to limit continuous buzz in high current situations.
    * BMS haptic buzz not implemented yet.
  * New Section "High Current" in Tune Modifiers
    * Allows the user to configure the maximum current of the motor
    * Adjust max current for higher duty cycles
    * Haptic buzz will activate at a user input margin from max current, if high current haptic buzz is enabled
    * Surge will activate at the max current, if surge is enabled
    * User input minimum ERPM implemented to prevent surge and/or haptic buzz in low speed situations.
  * Surge Overhaul
    * Changed surge trigger from pitch differential to high current, configured in the High Current section
    * Changed surge end condition to be based on a user input pitch to allow more flexible and stronger surges.

  * AppUI Overhaul
    * Debug Overhaul
      * New options on Specs tab allow for different debug text on the AppUI screen.

      * Surge debug
      * Tune debug. This includes pitch kp, stability, and roll kp information previously under Tune
    * New Trip data replaces Tune
      * Monitors board state to determine when the board is idle and displays ride vs rest time.
      * Ride/rest time is used to correct RT data for better ride data including current, speed and power averages.
    * Added last beep reason from Float Package 1.2 to AppUI screen
* _Fixes/Improvements_
  * Dynamic stability now works while riding switch
  * Fixed a bug originating in 1.1 that prevented traction control while riding switch

    * Increase pitch current and pitch rate response (kp rate) at higher speeds or with remote control.
    * Found in the tune modifiers menu.
    * Speed stability enabled by default
    * Enabling remote control stability disables remote tilt.
    * New indicators on AppUI for relative stability (0-100%) and the added kp and kp rate from stability applied to the pitch response.

    * Disabled by default.
    * Uses the same layout and logic as the acceleration menu.
* _Fixes/Improvements_

  * Reorganized the AppUI screen.
  * Cleaned up AppUI to remove unused quicksave buttons.
