# Trick and Trail VESC Package
by Mike Silberstein (send questions, comments, requests to izzyvesc@gmail.com)

Trick and Trail Package was developed based on Float Package 1.2 by Surfdado and Nico for self-balanced boards. It departs from the traditional PID control scheme that is rooted in the balance robot design. This is replaced with a user defined, current output curve that is based on board pitch. This allows for an infinite number of throttle/braking curves that gives the user the ability to truly tune the board how they want.

This package has been improved thanks to the contributions of Lukas Hrazky with Refloat.

### Features
* Pitch Tune - Current output defined by a series of points, input by the user.
* Roll Tune - for acceleration and braking, to improve board response.
* Yaw Tune - for acceleration and braking, to improve board response.
* Surge - high current response to help prevent nosedives.
* Traction Control - reduce free spin in the air. 
* Sticky Tilt - accurate, manual board level control with a remote.
* Dynamic Stability - faster board response at higher speeds or with a remote.
* Alternative proportional gain user inputs for pitch.
* Optional independent brake curve for pitch.
* High Duty FOC Tone - high speed warning.
* High Current FOC Tone - instant, high torque warning.

### Default Settings
Default settings are based on 20s battery, Hypercore (Future Motion motor), and Little Focer v3.1 set up. These are similar to the settings I ride for trails. One exception is surge which is disabled. Here are more details on the default settings:

* Pitch Tune - The default pitch tune is a simple beginner tune using only TNT Cfg->Acceleration kp0, kp rate, current 1 and pitch 1.
  * For a trick or trail tune you will want a lower kp0 and gradually increasing pitch angles and currents.
  * See TNT Cfg->Braking for an example trail riding tune.
* Roll Tune - The default roll tune is very loose and moderate for easy, deep carving.
  * To make the roll tighter and more race-like, decrease Level 2 Roll Angle.
  * To make the tune less aggressive decrease Roll Kp.
  * To make the tune less agile at low speed reduce the low speed maximum scaler.
  * To adjust the agility at high speed change the high speed maximum scaler.
* Yaw Tune - The default yaw tune is loose and moderately aggressive
  * To make the yaw tighter and more race-like, decrease Level 1 and Level 2 Yaw Angles.
  * To make the tune less aggressive decrease Yaw Kp.
* High Current
  * High current conditions are based on 150 peak amps, 30 battery amps, and hypercore motor.
  * Changes must be made for higher current motors like the cannoncore and superflux.
* Surge 
  * Disabled by default for safety.
  * Set your high current section first.
* Traction Control
  * Should work well for most boards. Light riders on powerful boards may need to increase Start Condition to prevent nuisance trips.
  * Decrease Transition Condition and increase End Condition for looser landings and less wheel spin.
  * Increase ERPM filter frequnecy for a faster response, decrease to control wheel spin for longer air time.
  * Traction Braking disabled by default.
* FOC Play Tones
  * Disabled by default because of potential issues with Absolute Max Motor Current. See warning in the help text.
  * Riders with cannoncore or superflux motors should set high current conditions before using high current FOC tones.

    * when idle... "READY-" and last stop/fault reason
    * when running... "RUNNING-" and tiltback reason
    * in traction control/wheelslip... "WHEELSLIP"
  * Readme format updated for 6.05
